            <p>

            </p>
            <h4 class="h4">Required data</h4>
            <p>
                The following information is requested and should therefore be at hand:
                <ul>
                    <li>Team name</li>
                    <li>Name of the club or association (if applicable)</li>
                    <li>Day of the week and time of home matches</li>
                    <li>Name and exact address of the venue</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h4 class="h4">Venue</h4>
            <p>
                To ensure that the match day can be determined automatically and without overlap, please note the following:
                <ul>
                    <li>All teams using one field of a venue at the same time must select that venue.</li>
                    <li>
                        If several fields are available at a venue that can be used simultaneously,
                        a separate venue should be created for each field, and assigned to the using team.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h4 class="h4">Team contacts</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    At least 2 team contacts should be defined for each team,
                    so that a substitute is arranged for absence or other reasons.
                </li>
                <li>The team contacts are displayed to members of other teams (and only to them).</li>
                <li>
                    In addition to the team contacts, players can be assigned to each team.
                    The contact details of the players are only accessible to team members.
                </li>
            </ul>
